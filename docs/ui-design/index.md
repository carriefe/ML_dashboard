# UI Design

## Wireframe

We made the prototype on Whimsical. The prototype is designed to provide users with a user-friendly interface to interact with machine learning models.


present users with two options - either to log in if they are an existing user, or sign up if they are new to the platform.

### Log-in page:

For existing users, they will need to provide their username and password to log in.

### Sign-up page:

For new users, they will be asked to input their name, usernam, password, and comfirm the password.

### Dashborad page:

provide users with an overview of their machine learning projects in one centralized location and the feature to create a new project.

### Metrics page:

display various graphs and charts that provide a visual representation of the performance metrics of the machine learning model. The page presents multiple charts that allow users to track different aspects of the model performance

## Stories

### Story 1

A new user visits the HyperTrain website and clicks on the sign-up button. HyperTrain prompts the new user to choose a unique username, explaining that usernames must be between 4 and 20 characters long and can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. The new user provide their name, username, a password and confirm the password. With a valid username, they successfully created an account. And then the website leads the new user to the log-in page.

### Story 2

A returning user visits the HyperTrain website and clicks on the log-in button. They enter their username and password and click on the log-in button. However there is a typo in their password. HyperTrain prompts the user that either their username or password is incorrect.
the user type their username and password correctly this time. HyperTrain authenticates their credentials and redirects them to their dashboard.

### Story 3

A user logs into HyperTrain and sees a dashboard with a list of their previous projects. They click on project 1 to view its details, including metadata and performance metrics such as accuracy and loss. They notice that the experiment did not perform well, so they create a new experiment with different hyperparameters. After running the new experiment, they compare the results to the previous one using the built-in visualization tools, and find that the new experiment has better performance. They record the results and move on to the next experiment.

## HTML & CSS Mockup

![HTML & CSS Mockup 1](https://github.com/umass-cs-326-s23/326-project-repo-team-45-1/blob/main/Mockup%20Screenshots/1.png)

The landing page for Hypertain features a modern and sleek design with a gradient color scheme. At the top left of the page, there is a navigation bar with links to various sections of the website, namely "Home" and "About". To the right of the navigation bar, there are buttons for "Sign Up", "Log In" and "Dashboard".

![HTML & CSS Mockup 2](https://github.com/umass-cs-326-s23/326-project-repo-team-45-1/blob/main/Mockup%20Screenshots/2.png)

Upon clicking the "Log in" button, the user is redirected to the log in page where they are prompted to enter their email address and password to log into their account. 

![HTML & CSS Mockup 3](https://github.com/umass-cs-326-s23/326-project-repo-team-45-1/blob/main/Mockup%20Screenshots/3.png)

Upon authentication of the user details, the user is logged into their account where they see a dashboard of all the projects they have worked on with a brief description of the project. Upon clicking on these individual project cards, the user is able to open up the project to view more details. There is a button on the upper left section of the page "Create new project" that allows them to create a new project. 

![HTML & CSS Mockup 4](https://github.com/umass-cs-326-s23/326-project-repo-team-45-1/blob/main/Mockup%20Screenshots/4.png)

When the user clicks the "About" option on the main page, a new page opens up that displays a brief description about Hypertrain and its various applications. Under this description, there is a simple explanation some peculiar features of the application. 

![HTML & CSS Mockup 5](https://github.com/umass-cs-326-s23/326-project-repo-team-45-1/blob/main/Mockup%20Screenshots/5.png)

Clicking the "Sign up" on the navigation bar brings the user to the sign up page where they are required to enter their name, their email address, a password of their choice and confirmation of that password. Upon clicking the Sign up button, a new account is created for them. 

![HTML & CSS Mockup 6](https://github.com/umass-cs-326-s23/326-project-repo-team-45-1/blob/main/Mockup%20Screenshots/6.png)

When the "Create a new project" button is clicked, they are prompted to enter the name of the new project along with which they can invite other members to collaborate on the project. Clicking on the Create Project button creates a new project with the specified title and all the involved contributors.
