Innovative Idea:

We aim to built a web-based machine learning dashboard. The app would be used for visualizing and analyzing hyperparamater tuning for machine learning models. It provides a solution for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and developers to streamline their workflow from data preparation and model training to deployment and monitoring. The dashboard integrates various open-source libraries and tools, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch to offer a flexible and customizable environment for machine learning development. Additionally, it includes a range of advanced features, such as experiment tracking, collaboration, and real-time monitoring, to enhance productivity. This dashboard is similar to other existing applications, such as Google Cloud AI Platform, but it aims to provide a more accessible and user-friendly interface for both novice and experienced users.


Data:
1. Training and Testing Data: This will include data that the users would need for training and testing their ML models.

2. ML Model-related data: This includes aspects of the model (such as hyperparamers) that the user would like to experiment with.

3. Model Predictions/Inferences: Our back end will need to fetch the prediction of the ML models and provide insights (accuracy, loss).

4. Visualization: We will also need to store graphs generated by analyzing the predictions of the ML model.

 <!-- provides a list of the data your application will support. For each data type, you must include a brief description of the data and how it will be used in your application. For example, if you are creating a recipe application, you might have a data type for recipes. You would then describe what a recipe is and how it will be used in your application. You must include at least four different types of data (excluding user data (e.g., username, email, avatar)). -->

Functionality:

1. Experiment Tracking - This functionality will enable users to keep track the metrics of their models and experiments. Users will be able to record metadata and results for each experiment, compare and visualize multiple runs.

2. Model training and Evaluation - This functionality will enable users to train, fine-tune, and evaluate their machine learning models. Users will be able to choose from various algorithms and hyperparameters, set up training and validation pipelines, and monitor training progress and performance metrics. This functionality will be critical for building and optimizing ML models.

3. Data Management - This functionality will enable users to manage their datasets and results, including uploading, downloading, and deleting files. Users will be able to create and organize datasets, preview their contents. This functionality will be essential for data pre-processing and exploration.

4. User Authentication and Login - Users will be able to create an account, log in, and manage their profile information.
